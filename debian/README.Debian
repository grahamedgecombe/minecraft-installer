minecraft-installer for Debian
------------------------------

This package installs the Minecraft client and server by downloading it from
the official Minecraft website. This package does *not* contain the Minecraft
client itself as that would breach copyright laws and the wishes of Markus
Persson, the author of Minecraft.
